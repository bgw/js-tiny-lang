program pr3c30:

{This tiny program will test the use of a for loop control
variable of type char.  It should print the twenty-six letters
of the alphabet (both upper-case and lower-case) and the numbers
corresponding to their position in the
 alphabet.

     Output generated:
         A      1
         B      2
         C      3
          ...
         Z     26
         a      1
         b      2
         c      3
          ...
         z     26
}

var c: char;

begin
  for c := 'A' to 'Z' do
     output(c, "\t", (ord(c)-ord('A'))+1);
  for c := 'a' to 'z' do 
     output(c, "\t", (ord(c)-ord('a'))+1);
