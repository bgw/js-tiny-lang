{
	This is a program to compute the factors of entered numbers.
	It tests:
		procedures
		repeat loop
		if statement
		arithmetic
}
program factors:

var
    i : integer; 

procedure Factor ( i : integer );
var
    j : integer;
begin
    if i > 0 then
	for j := 1 to i do
	    if i mod j = 0 then output ( j )
end Factor;

begin

    repeat
	read(i);
	Factor ( i )
    until i <= 0

end factors.
